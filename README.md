ABC Fitness is a demo web app built with HTML, Bootstrap, and jQuery. Its design was planned in Figma, applying basic UI/UX principles like intuitive navigation and responsive layouts. The app uses local storage to persist user preferences and settings, ensuring they remain available across sessions, and session storage to hold user-specific data temporarily during active sessions for an enhanced experience. For design references, you can check the Figma layouts:
